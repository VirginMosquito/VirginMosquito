- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m JÃ©rÃ©my Martinet
 During my former life, I worked in market finances and purchases. Throught these jobs I've developped some advanced Excel/powerPivot tools and dealt with databases throught Hyperion.
 These experiences have given me motivation to learn code. 
 After the Wagon courses I'm now sure that the code will give me:
 - intellectual stimulation
 - response to my curiosity

I have got strong basics on: 
- ruby on rails
- html/css
- javascript
- SQL
